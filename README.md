# DUNGEON DIO

Practical project to reinforce knowledge in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#.

### Goals:

## Object-Orientation 
- It is a programming paradigm
- Code reuse
- Bring the code closer to something in the real world
- Makes code maintenance easier

## The 4 pillars of object-oriented programming are:

Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
